a tarot card reader, tarot.rb

this is just a bit of fun, a tarot card reader for the command line

it's based on the three-card-spread idea: http://www.tarotpedia.com/wiki/Three_card_spread

(ttarot.rb is all you need, the other files are odds and sods i meade while thinking about more complex approaches)
