==========

This started out as a tarot card reader for the command line based on the three-card-spread idea: http://www.tarotpedia.com/wiki/Three_card_spread

Then I came across a set of card image that are out of copyright and made it in to a Sinatra webapp

To do:
 - add other card metadata (descriptions, corresponsences, etc)
 - modularise - basically one file atm
 - add other spreads (celtic cross etc) + explanations
